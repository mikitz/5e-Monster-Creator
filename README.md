# 5e-Monster-Creator
This local web app uses the system devised by [u/Rothner](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rothner/) and posted on Reddit ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/t5ru2t/two_point_buy_systems_one_flashcard_any_monster/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) to create homebrew monsters within a certain CR. This sytem was further used to create a monster generator that's totally random or based on various user inputs.
